# Thread pool properties
# These numbers control the backend's performance on scale
#   basically keeping the backend stable and performant even with high
#   demand spikes

# All properties are commented-out since default values are optimal for most
#   cases and are calculated dynamically based on the machine's number of cores
# And values are left empty - all types are integers

# Used for new threads for in-memory operations
# Default: min ((number of processor cores + 1) * 10, 1000)

# Used for cassandra's blocking operations
# Default: number of processor cores + 1

# Used by the dispatcher
# Default: number of processor cores + 1

# Used by the REST client
# Default: number of processor cores + 1
